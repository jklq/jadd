# JADD - Jklq's Automatic Dotfile-Deployer
I want to make a customized version of [LARBS](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS) that fits me.

## Features I want
- Use my custom dotfile repo by default
- Use my progs list by default  
  - Use my custom suckless builds and other projects that are built from source
- Take my personal files from a VPS
